# No Zero Address checks when transferring `transferAccumulator.amount`  and this can lead to lock up of funds

## Summary
_executeERC20DirectTransfer does not perform any zero checks before transfer.
## Vulnerability Detail
Before `transferAccumulator.amount` is being sent, there are no zero checks performed which can lead to transfering to an invalid address.

## Impact
This can lead to lock up of funds.
