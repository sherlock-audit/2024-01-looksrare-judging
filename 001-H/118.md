# In `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds`, cutoff time is set even if nothing is deposited

## Summary

In `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds`, cutoff time is set even if nothing is deposited

## Vulnerability Detail

In `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds`, `_setCutoffTimeIfNotSet(startingRound)` is called even if amounts[0] = 0 (which is possible because only `msg.value = 0` is checked). 

This means that, even without a deposit, the timer on the round will start. This against the design spec, which states:

`The cutoff time of each round is only set on the first deposit or when there are already deposits in the round and it's being transitioned to Open.`

## Impact

Cutoff time will be set without deposit being made

## Recommendation

Don't set cutoff time unless amounts[0] != 0
