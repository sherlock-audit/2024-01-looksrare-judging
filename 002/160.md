# Unlike ERC20, where users can specify an amount to minimize the loss in rounding down during division, users participating with NFT suffer loss

## Summary
Unlike ERC20, where users can specify an amount to minimize the loss in rounding down during division, users participating with NFT suffer loss

## Vulnerability Detail
In `_deposit()` it is dividing the floor price of the NFT collection with `valuePerEntry`, unlike ERC20, where users can specify an amount to minimize the loss in rounding down during division, NFT floor price is directly divided by `valuePerEntry`, and in Solidity the result of division will be rounded down, and the `entriesCount` the user have will be worth less than the floor price of the NFT collection

## Impact
Users entering to a round with NFT suffer loss

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a smaller value to divide the price to get the `entriesCount` to minimize the loss
