# Tokens with blacklist functionality may cause funds being frozen forever

## Summary
USDC is supported by the protocol, but some a winner who is blacklisted by the token will not be able to claim the reward in full, causing funds being frozen forever.
## Vulnerability Detail
USDC has a blacklist option. Consider the following scenario
1. Alice joins a round with ETH.
2. Bob joins with USDC tokens.
3. Alice wins the round, but her address is blacklisted by USDC.
As a result Alice cannot claim the USDC that Bob used to enter the round, because only winner can claim the rewards and her address is blacklisted.
## Impact
If a winner is in the USDC blacklist, USDC rewards will be frozen. And trying to withdraw them will always revert
