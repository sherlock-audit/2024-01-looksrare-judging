# `claimPrizes()` will revert when `msg.value > round.protocolFeeOwed`

## Summary
`claimPrizes()` will revert when `msg.value > round.protocolFeeOwed`

## Vulnerability Detail
`getClaimPrizesPaymentRequired()` function may return incorrect result depends on user input, so user can pass enough eth to `claimPrizes()` function and expect to receive remained fund.
But `claimPrizes()` always assume that msg.value <= round.protocolFeeOwed
So claimPrizes() may revert with underflow when user pass enough eth to this function
