# A ready to be withdrawn round can be forcefully extended  by a single user

## Summary

A malicious depositor can forcefully extend a ready-to-be withdrawn round.

## Vulnerability Detail

**STATE**
`roundCount = 1` - **OUR CURRENT ROUND STATE**

Depositors can deposit for future(multiple) rounds by `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds`:

```solidity
    function depositETHIntoMultipleRounds(uint256[] calldata amounts) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {

        uint256 numberOfRounds = amounts.length;

        if (msg.value == 0 || numberOfRounds == 0) {
            revert ZeroDeposits();
        }

        uint256 startingRoundId = roundsCount;

        Round storage startingRound = rounds[startingRoundId];

        _validateRoundIsOpen(startingRound);

        _setCutoffTimeIfNotSet(startingRound);

        uint256 expectedValue;

        uint256[] memory entriesCounts = new uint256[](numberOfRounds);
 
        for (uint256 i; i < numberOfRounds; ++i) {

            uint256 roundId = _unsafeAdd(startingRoundId, i);

            Round storage round = rounds[roundId];

            uint256 roundValuePerEntry = round.valuePerEntry;

            if (roundValuePerEntry == 0) {
                (, , roundValuePerEntry) = _writeDataToRound({roundId: roundId, roundValue: 0});
            }

            _incrementUserDepositCount(roundId, round);

            uint256 depositAmount = amounts[i];

            if (depositAmount % roundValuePerEntry != 0) {
                revert InvalidValue();
            }

            uint256 entriesCount = _depositETH(round, roundId, roundValuePerEntry, depositAmount);

            expectedValue += depositAmount;

            entriesCounts[i] = entriesCount;
        }

        if (expectedValue != msg.value) {
            revert InvalidValue();
        }

        emit MultipleRoundsDeposited(msg.sender, startingRoundId, amounts, entriesCounts);

        if (
            _shouldDrawWinner(
                startingRound.numberOfParticipants,
                startingRound.maximumNumberOfParticipants,
                startingRound.deposits.length
            )
        ) {
            _drawWinner(startingRound, startingRoundId);
        }
        
    }

```

A group of depositors want take part in the **next round(2)** by using the above function, they can do that and fill the whole round with the needed deposits count in order to be considered valid to be withdrawn(finalized):

```solidity
function _shouldDrawWinner(
        uint256 numberOfParticipants,
        uint256 maximumNumberOfParticipants,
        uint256 roundDepositCount
    ) private pure returns (bool shouldDraw) {
        shouldDraw =
            numberOfParticipants == maximumNumberOfParticipants ||
            (numberOfParticipants > 1 && roundDepositCount == MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND);
    }
```

Now they must wait for the **current** round to finish in order for them to be able to finalize the next **round(2)**, but in the meantime, a malicious user can extended the withdraw period for the next round. Here is how:

In `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds` it is possible to get free entries to a round, **BUT** there is a catch, for example if I want to get free entries for the second(next) round, I would have to construct the input array the following way [1eth, 0], the catch is that there always must be some value > 0, I will explain in detail now:

Back to `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds`, just keep in mind that we are still in the first round:

```solidity
function depositETHIntoMultipleRounds(uint256[] calldata amounts) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {

        uint256 numberOfRounds = amounts.length;

        if (msg.value == 0 || numberOfRounds == 0) {
            revert ZeroDeposits();
        }

        uint256 startingRoundId = roundsCount;

        Round storage startingRound = rounds[startingRoundId];

        _validateRoundIsOpen(startingRound);

        _setCutoffTimeIfNotSet(startingRound);

        uint256 expectedValue;

        uint256[] memory entriesCounts = new uint256[](numberOfRounds);
 
        for (uint256 i; i < numberOfRounds; ++i) {

            uint256 roundId = _unsafeAdd(startingRoundId, i);

            Round storage round = rounds[roundId];

            uint256 roundValuePerEntry = round.valuePerEntry;

            if (roundValuePerEntry == 0) {
                (, , roundValuePerEntry) = _writeDataToRound({roundId: roundId, roundValue: 0});
            }

            _incrementUserDepositCount(roundId, round);

            uint256 depositAmount = amounts[i];
            
            if (depositAmount % roundValuePerEntry != 0) {
                revert InvalidValue();
            }

            uint256 entriesCount = _depositETH(round, roundId, roundValuePerEntry, depositAmount);

            expectedValue += depositAmount;

            entriesCounts[i] = entriesCount;
        }

        if (expectedValue != msg.value) {
            revert InvalidValue();
        }

        emit MultipleRoundsDeposited(msg.sender, startingRoundId, amounts, entriesCounts);

        if (
            _shouldDrawWinner(
                startingRound.numberOfParticipants,
                startingRound.maximumNumberOfParticipants,
                startingRound.deposits.length
            )
        ) {
            _drawWinner(startingRound, startingRoundId);
        }
        
    }

```

**STATE**

`roundCount = 1` - still active, not ready to be drawn(finished).

**NEXT ROUND**
Second round - not active, waiting for the current round to finish in order for it to become the current, but it's ready to be withdrawn because `roundDepositCount == MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND`.

Now when we go back at `_shouldDrawWinner` we see that in order for a round to be considered valid to be withdrawn it should: 

```solidity
shouldDraw =
            numberOfParticipants == maximumNumberOfParticipants ||
            (numberOfParticipants > 1 && roundDepositCount == MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND);
```

Either max participants or max deposits, have currently done the second thing(deposits), keep in mind that they should be `roundDepositCount == MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND` - **!! == !!** . So if we somehow can make + 1 deposit this statement won't be true and we would have to somehow get other depositors to deposit in our round in order to reach `numberOfParticipants == maximumNumberOfParticipants` since like I said if we somehow manage to get more than `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND` this will never return true. Well spoiler alert, it's possible.

Back to the `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds`: 

We can actually construct the input `uint256[] calldata amounts` such way that we can get a free entry for the round.
`uint256[] calldata amounts = [1eth, 0]` - 1 eth for the first round, 0 for the second - this is completely valid input for this function.

`
uint256 numberOfRounds = amounts.length;

if (msg.value == 0 || numberOfRounds == 0) {
            revert ZeroDeposits();
        }
`
This if check will pass since we have some eth for the first round and numOfRounds is 2.

Now let's get into the for loop in the function:

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < numberOfRounds; ++i) {

            uint256 roundId = _unsafeAdd(startingRoundId, i);

            Round storage round = rounds[roundId];

            uint256 roundValuePerEntry = round.valuePerEntry;

            if (roundValuePerEntry == 0) {
                (, , roundValuePerEntry) = _writeDataToRound({roundId: roundId, roundValue: 0});
            }

            _incrementUserDepositCount(roundId, round);

            uint256 depositAmount = amounts[i];
            
            if (depositAmount % roundValuePerEntry != 0) {
                revert InvalidValue();
            }

            uint256 entriesCount = _depositETH(round, roundId, roundValuePerEntry, depositAmount);

            expectedValue += depositAmount;

            entriesCounts[i] = entriesCount;
        }
```

Keep in mind that 1eth is just a value to make things easier, let's assume that it will not fill up the first round and we go to the second already filled up round but with 0 as an amount, we can see that `_incrementUserDepositCount` will just add us as participants for the round, but then `uint256 entriesCount = _depositETH(round, roundId, roundValuePerEntry, depositAmount);` will actually push our deposit to the second round with no checks if the maximum value for deposits has been reached!

```solidity
function _depositETH(
        Round storage round,
        uint256 roundId,
        uint256 roundValuePerEntry,
        uint256 depositAmount
    ) private returns (uint256 entriesCount) {

        entriesCount = depositAmount / roundValuePerEntry;

        uint256 roundDepositCount = round.deposits.length;

        _validateOnePlayerCannotFillUpTheWholeRound(_unsafeAdd(roundDepositCount, 1), round.numberOfParticipants);

        uint40 currentEntryIndex = _getCurrentEntryIndexWithoutAccrual(round, roundDepositCount, entriesCount);
        
        // This is equivalent to
        // round.deposits.push(
        //     Deposit({
        //         tokenType: YoloV2__TokenType.ETH,
        //         tokenAddress: address(0),
        //         tokenId: 0,
        //         tokenAmount: msg.value,
        //         depositor: msg.sender,
        //         withdrawn: false,
        //         currentEntryIndex: currentEntryIndex
        //     })
        // );
        // unchecked {
        //     roundDepositCount += 1;
        // }
        uint256 roundDepositsLengthSlot = _getRoundSlot(roundId) + ROUND__DEPOSITS_LENGTH_SLOT_OFFSET;

        uint256 depositDataSlotWithCountOffset = _getDepositDataSlotWithCountOffset(
            roundDepositsLengthSlot,
            roundDepositCount
        );

        // We don't have to write tokenType, tokenAddress, tokenId, and withdrawn because they are 0.
        _writeDepositorAndCurrentEntryIndexToDeposit(depositDataSlotWithCountOffset, currentEntryIndex);
        _writeDepositAmountToDeposit(depositDataSlotWithCountOffset, depositAmount);

        assembly {
            sstore(roundDepositsLengthSlot, add(roundDepositCount, 1))
        }

    }

```

In this function there is no check to prevent more deposits than intended so now our deposits for this round are actually > MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND and in order for this round to be considered as ready to be withdrawn it must fill up with participants. However that's not the problem. So now since our +1 deposit is made this will always return false until the round is filled up with participants:

```solidity
function _shouldDrawWinner(
        uint256 numberOfParticipants,
        uint256 maximumNumberOfParticipants,
        uint256 roundDepositCount
    ) private pure returns (bool shouldDraw) {
        shouldDraw =
            numberOfParticipants == maximumNumberOfParticipants ||
            (numberOfParticipants > 1 && roundDepositCount == MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND);
    }
```

Now assume that the first round has been finalized and `_startRound` has been called to start the next second round:

```solidity
function _startRound(uint256 _roundsCount) private returns (uint256 roundId) {

        unchecked {
            roundId = _roundsCount + 1;
        }

        roundsCount = uint40(roundId);

        Round storage round = rounds[roundId];
        
        //if there is existing information for this current round, go in
        if (round.valuePerEntry == 0) {
            
            //create the additional info in order to get this round going
            // On top of the 4 values covered by _writeDataToRound, this also writes the round's status to Open (1).
            _writeDataToRound({roundId: roundId, roundValue: 1});

            emit RoundStatusUpdated(roundId, RoundStatus.Open);

        } else {

            uint256 numberOfParticipants = round.numberOfParticipants;

            if (
                !paused() &&
                _shouldDrawWinner(numberOfParticipants, round.maximumNumberOfParticipants, round.deposits.length)
            ) {

                _drawWinner(round, roundId);

            }
            
            
             else {

                uint40 _roundDuration = roundDuration;

                // This is equivalent to
                // round.status = RoundStatus.Open;
                // if (round.numberOfParticipants > 0) {
                //   round.cutoffTime = uint40(block.timestamp) + _roundDuration;
                // }
                uint256 roundSlot = _getRoundSlot(roundId);

                assembly {

                    // RoundStatus.Open is equal to 1.
                    let roundValue := or(sload(roundSlot), 1)

                    if gt(numberOfParticipants, 0) {
                        roundValue := or(roundValue, shl(ROUND__CUTOFF_TIME_OFFSET, add(timestamp(), _roundDuration)))
                    }

                    sstore(roundSlot, roundValue)
                }

                emit RoundStatusUpdated(roundId, RoundStatus.Open);
            }
        }
    }
```

Now the problem here is that `round.valuePerEntry` has already been set for that round, then the second if will be skipped too because `_shouldDrawWinner` will always return false now until maxParticipants is met, and we go straight into the **else** which will:

```solidity
           else {

                uint40 _roundDuration = roundDuration;

                // This is equivalent to
                // round.status = RoundStatus.Open;
                // if (round.numberOfParticipants > 0) {
                //   round.cutoffTime = uint40(block.timestamp) + _roundDuration;
                // }
                uint256 roundSlot = _getRoundSlot(roundId);

                assembly {

                    // RoundStatus.Open is equal to 1.
                    let roundValue := or(sload(roundSlot), 1)

                    if gt(numberOfParticipants, 0) {
                        roundValue := or(roundValue, shl(ROUND__CUTOFF_TIME_OFFSET, add(timestamp(), _roundDuration)))
                    }

                    sstore(roundSlot, roundValue)
                }

                emit RoundStatusUpdated(roundId, RoundStatus.Open);
            }
        }
    }

```

And now we have an over-fullfilled round with deposits, which has an `round.cutoffTime = uint40(block.timestamp) + _roundDuration;` and is **OPEN**.

This will temporary brick the round since there is 2 ways in order to be finalized - either more recipients should join in order to make this statement return true `numberOfParticipants == maximumNumberOfParticipants`(which might not be incentivizing for the people to join) or the whole `roundDuration` should pass in order to invoke `drawWinner`.

## Impact

User can forcefully extend the finalizing of a round.
