# Block x future rounds with lower than expected ETH

## Summary
Attacker can block the system for x number of future rounds with only 100 eth

## Vulnerability Detail
When using [depositETHIntoMultipleRounds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L312) we can create deposits of eth on future rounds. If any of the rounds amount is valid (x % valuePerEntry) and the rest is zero, we can still create all deposits. So we can create one deposit on multiple rounds in the future with only 1 eth, when we should not be able to create multiple deposits with that amount of eth.

If an attacker wants to get x deposits (limited to the block gas limit) he only needs to send 1 value per entry (1 eth), when it should be x eth. He only needs to call the function [depositETHIntoMultipleRounds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L312) with 1eth as msg.value and an array of zeroes with only 1 element with 1 eth.

Still, these betting positions are worthless, because when calculating the winner the possible numbers to choose as winner will always be above 1, and the fake positions the attacker created are equivalent to 0.

But if the attacker wants to stop the system entirely for the next x rounds, he only needs 100 eth (that he can recover). The max number of deposits is defined by [MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L81). Once this number is reached in a round, we cannot deposit more. He only needs to call depositETHIntoMultipleRounds 100 times with 1 eth each call and with an array of length equal to the amount of rounds blocked. This will create 100 deposits on the future rounds avoiding anyone to make more deposits.

The attacker can recover the money on each finished round and repeat the process when getting back the 100 eth.

## Impact
Denial-of-service attack on the system, during an undefined period. With 100eth and 2 addresses (to avoid being blocked because of being the “Same” player).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Create a check to verify that the entries count for each one of the deposits is above 1.
