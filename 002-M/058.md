# `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds` allows to bypass `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND` which can lead to OOG in `fulfillRandomWords`

## Summary
`depositETHIntoMultipleRounds` allows to bypass `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND` 

## Vulnerability Detail
Rounds have a `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND` which is the max number of deposits allowed in a single round. When depositing in a live round, there is a check that this limit is not met. However, when depositing in future rounds via `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds` there isn't such check 
```solidity
        for (uint256 i; i < numberOfRounds; ++i) {
            uint256 roundId = _unsafeAdd(startingRoundId, i);
            Round storage round = rounds[roundId];
            uint256 roundValuePerEntry = round.valuePerEntry;
            if (roundValuePerEntry == 0) {
                (, , roundValuePerEntry) = _writeDataToRound({roundId: roundId, roundValue: 0});
            }

            _incrementUserDepositCount(roundId, round);

            uint256 depositAmount = amounts[i];
            if (depositAmount % roundValuePerEntry != 0) {
                revert InvalidValue();
            }
            uint256 entriesCount = _depositETH(round, roundId, roundValuePerEntry, depositAmount);
            expectedValue += depositAmount;

            entriesCounts[i] = entriesCount;
        }
```
This would allow for an arbitrary big number of deposits for a round. 

`fulfillRandomWords` loops through all deposits. Given big enough number, this could run out of gas. This would cause a round to be unable to be drawn. 
```solidity
                uint256[] memory currentEntryIndexArray = new uint256[](count);
                for (uint256 i; i < count; ++i) {
                    currentEntryIndexArray[i] = uint256(round.deposits[i].currentEntryIndex);
                }
```

## Recommendation
add a check for `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND` even in `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds`
