# Chain reorganization allow validators to influence the requested random number

## Summary
Chain reorganization allows validators to influence the requested random number.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function [`_drawWinner()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L1004) requests a random number from chainlink by specifying a `minimumRequestConfirmations` of 3 blocks. 

Some chains undergo deep chain reorganizations that might allow a validator to gain an unfair advantage as [described in the chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/security#choose-a-safe-block-confirmation-time-which-will-vary-between-blockchains). One example of such chain is polygon which had a [32 blocks re-org](https://polygonscan.com/block/43199239/f?hash=0xe53d0f52cc8e06f9738996330493aabe6931ab6ebf8a359c1a188bca218f470d) less than 1 year ago.

## Impact
Validators might gain an unfair advantage because they have the ability to re-roll the dice.

## Recommendation

Consider choosing an appropriate `minimumRequestConfirmations` based on the chain the protocol is deployed on.
