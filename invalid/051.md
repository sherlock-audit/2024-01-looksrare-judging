# `_protocolFeeOwedInLOOKS` returns the wrong amount of LOOKS to pay

## Summary
The function [`_protocolFeeOwedInLOOKS()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L1669-L1676) returns the wrong amount of LOOKS to pay as a fee to the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol allows users to get a discount on the fees they have to pay if they pay in LOOKS. The function responsible for calculating the amount of LOOKS owed is [`_protocolFeeOwedInLOOKS()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L1669-L1676) and it does so based on the value of the `protocolFeeDiscountBp` variable:
```solidity
protocolFeeOwedInLOOKS = (1e18 * protocolFeeOwedInETH * protocolFeeDiscountBp) / erc20Oracle.getTWAP(LOOKS, uint32(TWAP_DURATION)) / 10_000;
```

As an example if the variable `protocolFeeDiscountBp` is set to `3_000` users are supposed to get a 30% discount when paying with LOOKS, but they get a 70% discount instead. The easiest way to see why this is the case is by thinking about what would happen if users were supposed to receive a 0% discount (ie. `protocolFeeDiscountBp` set to 0):
```solidity
protocolFeeOwedInLOOKS = (1e18 * protocolFeeOwedInETH * 0) / erc20Oracle.getTWAP(LOOKS, uint32(TWAP_DURATION)) / 10_000
```

`1e18 * protocolFeeOwedInETH * 0` would return 0 and as a consequence `protocolFeeOwedInLOOKS` would be 0, meaning users would pay 0 LOOKS when they are supposed to not receive a discount and pay the full amount.

## Impact

Users might overpay/underpay fees when paying with LOOKS and the protocol might receive more or fewer fees than it should based on the value of `protocolFeeDiscountBp`.

## Recommendation

Correct the code to:
```solidity
protocolFeeOwedInLOOKS = (1e18 * protocolFeeOwedInETH * (10_000 - protocolFeeDiscountBp)) / erc20Oracle.getTWAP(LOOKS, uint32(TWAP_DURATION)) / 10_000;
```
