# VRF `Request Confirmations` Fixed At 3 in contract which is < Depth Of Chain ReOrgs For Chain To Be Deployed On

## Summary
When requesting randomness in the `_drawWinner` function, the `minimumRequestConfirmations` parameter is set to 3. This value must be greater than the depth of common chain re-organizations on the chains the `YoloV2`  is to be deployed, as chain re-organizations re-order blocks & transactions, which can affect the returned randomness.
