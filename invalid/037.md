# Potential Denial of Service (DoS) Attack due to Unbounded withdrawalCalldata Array Processing in claimPrizes Function

## Summary

Winners might have to pay more in transaction fees when claiming prizes in the YoloV2 contract if there are too many prizes to claim at once.

## Vulnerability Detail

The` claimPrizes` function in the YoloV2 contract iterates over each `WithdrawalCalldata[]` in the input array. For each `WithdrawalCalldata[]`, it retrieves the corresponding round and validates that the round has been drawn and that the message sender is the winner. As the size of the `withdrawalCalldata[]` array increases, the gas required to execute the function also increases. This could lead to higher transaction costs for winners when claiming their prizes.

## Impact
Winners may need to pay higher gas fees to claim their prizes if the `withdrawalCalldata []`array is large. This could potentially discourage participation in the contract, as the cost of claiming prizes could outweigh the value of the prizes themselves.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this risk, consider implementing a limit on the size of the `withdrawalCalldata[] `array that the `claimPrizes` function will accept. This will prevent the function from consuming excessive gas and protect winners from potentially high transaction costs.
