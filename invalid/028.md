# M-01: Functions return types but no return happens

## Summary

The identified issue pertains to a low-severity vulnerability in the functions within the YolowV2.sol contract. The issue involves the mismatch between the declared return type of the functions and the absence of a return statement within its body.

## Vulnerability Detail

The below mentioned functions declare a return type, indicating that it should return a value, but the function body lacks any explicit return statement. This inconsistency might lead to unexpected behavior, as the function could inadvertently return uninitialized or unpredictable data.

- ```_startRound()```

- ```_writeDataToRound()```

- ```_depositETH()```

- ```_getReservoirPrice()```

- ```_getDepositDataSlotWithCountOffset()```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L1698

- ```_shouldDrawWinner()```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L1715


## Impact

While the severity of this issue is considered medium, it introduces ambiguity regarding the expected return behavior of the function. The absence of a proper return statement may lead to unintended consequences, potentially affecting the correctness of the contract execution. 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-only
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

contract YoloV2 {

    uint256 public controlVar;

    function _startRound(uint256 _roundsCount) public returns (uint256 roundId) {
        
        _roundsCount += 1;
        controlVar = _roundsCount;

        //return roundId;
    }
}
```

- Remix IDE
- Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this issue, explicitly define a return statement within all functions that returns the expected data or update the function signature by removing the return type if no meaningful data needs to be returned. The recommended code will be submitted as separate comment.
