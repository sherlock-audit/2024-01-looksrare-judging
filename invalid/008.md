# YoloV2::signatureValidityPeriod, owner can support the signature validity and extend time window to any length

## Summary
Owner can support the signature validity and extend its validity to any length of time 

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a possibility for owner to support the validity-period for a signature, which might be expired by update the signatureValidityPeriod using _updateSignatureValidityPeriod() function.

This opens a vulnerability, where in the owner can extend the ReservoirSignature to any length, that the  owner desires.

## Impact
Potential abuse of floor price from Reservoir oracle is possible.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L1600C14-L1626

```solidity
 if (block.timestamp > floorPrice.timestamp + uint256(signatureValidityPeriod)) {
            revert SignatureExpired();
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The recommendation is to store the applicable signatureValidityPeriod in the deposit itself, similar to how ReservoirOracleFloorPrice is being stored.

Doing so will remove the impact of signatureValidityPeriod state variable being updated with new value, hence will close this vulnerability.
