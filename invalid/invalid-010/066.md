# Unauthorized Access to `YoloV2::cancelAfterRandomnessRequest`

## Summary

Anyone can call `YoloV2::cancelAfterRandomnessRequest` function, allowing users who didn't win to refund their deposits and prevent the winner from withdrawing their prizes.

## Vulnerability Detail

`YoloV2::cancelAfterRandomnessRequest` function should only be callable by the owner if the randomness request does not arrive after a certain amount of time.
     However, `YoloV2::cancelAfterRandomnessRequest` lacks proper access control, allowing unauthorized users to cancel the round after this certain amount of time.

## Impact

Unauthorized users who did not win can exploit this vulnerability to cancel the round, refund or rollover their deposits if there are any, and prevent the legitimate winner from withdrawing their prizes.
