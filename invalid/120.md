# Unchecked External Call in deposit Function

## Summary
The **deposit** function within the contract performs an unchecked external call to **transferBatchItemsAcrossCollections** function of the **transferManager**. This external call lacks proper checks and validation, potentially allowing reentrancy attacks or other unexpected behaviors.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the **deposit** function, there is a loop where **transferBatchItemsAcrossCollections** is called for each deposit. However, the return value of this function is not checked, and there are no safeguards against reentrancy. If the **transferManager** contract behaves maliciously or unexpectedly, it could lead to loss of funds or other critical issues.
## Impact
If the **transferManager** contract is compromised or contains vulnerabilities, it could lead to loss of user funds or the ability to manipulate contract state in an unauthorized manner.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement checks and validation for the return value of the external call to **transferBatchItemsAcrossCollections**. Consider using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy issues. Additionally, ensure that **transferManager** is a trusted contract and consider implementing a mechanism to upgrade or replace it if vulnerabilities are discovered in the future.

Suggested Fix

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < deposits.length; ++i) {
    // ...
    bool transferSuccess = transferManager.transferBatchItemsAcrossCollections(batchTransferItems, msg.sender, address(this));
    require(transferSuccess, "TransferManager: transfer failed");
    // ...
}
```
Add appropriate error handling or revert messages to inform users about the failure and ensure that the contract state remains consistent and secure.
