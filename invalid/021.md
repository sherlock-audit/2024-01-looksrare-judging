# Reentrancy Attack

## Summary
The YoloV2 contract's deposit function and other functions that interact with external contracts are potentially vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. Reentrancy is a common vulnerability in smart contracts where a contract calls an external contract, which then calls back into the calling contract before the first invocation is complete.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract functions such as deposit, depositETHIntoMultipleRounds, and claimPrizes interact with external contracts or addresses. Although the nonReentrant modifier is used, the complex interactions with multiple external contracts still pose a risk, especially if any of these contracts are malicious or compromised. The specific concern is that the state changes (e.g., balance updates, round management) happen after these external calls, which can be exploited by a malicious contract to re-enter and manipulate the contract state or drain funds.

## Impact
If exploited, an attacker can perform unauthorized actions within a single transaction, potentially leading to loss of funds, double-spending, or other unexpected behaviors that can compromise the contract's integrity and user assets.

## Code Snippet

This function, and particularly the _deposit internal function it calls, may interact with external contracts and is a potential point of vulnerability.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Move State Changes Up: Ensure that all state changes occur before any external calls to prevent any intermediary state from being exploited.
2. Check-Effects-Interactions Pattern: Follow the Check-Effects-Interactions pattern diligently to reduce the surface for reentrancy attacks.
3. Use Reentrancy Guard: Continue using the nonReentrant modifier from the ReentrancyGuard contract for all functions that make external calls.
4. Additional Security Measures for External Calls: When interacting with external contracts, consider adding additional security measures such as:

- Pull over Push for External Calls: Instead of pushing funds to an address, let the address pull the funds. This reduces the attack surface.
- Time Locks or Delays: Implement time locks or delays for critical functions to provide a window for action in case of an attack.
