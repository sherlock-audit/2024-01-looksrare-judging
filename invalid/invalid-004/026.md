# Oracle Manipulation or Failure

## Summary
The contract relies on **erc20Oracle** and **reservoirOracle** for critical external data, specifically for ERC20 token prices and NFT floor prices. The integrity and reliability of these oracles are crucial for the contract's correct operation.
## Vulnerability Detail
The reliance on external oracles introduces risks of data manipulation or unavailability. If an oracle provides incorrect data or is compromised, it might lead to incorrect calculations or decisions within the contract, such as incorrect pricing of ERC20 tokens or incorrect valuation of NFTs.
## Impact
Incorrect or manipulated data from an oracle can lead to wrong valuations or operations, affecting critical operations like deposits, withdrawals, or prize distributions, potentially leading to financial losses for users or affecting the contract's credibility.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. **Use Decentralized Oracles**: Where possible, use oracles that aggregate data from multiple independent sources.
2. **Oracle Failover Mechanisms**: Have backup oracles or mechanisms to switch oracles if the primary one fails.
3. **Data Validation**: Implement checks to validate oracle data against sudden, unrealistic changes in values.
4. **Monitor Oracle Health**: Regularly monitor the health and integrity of the oracle data.
