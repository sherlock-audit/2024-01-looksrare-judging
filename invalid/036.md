# `protocolFeeOwed` is not updated after paying with LOOKS in the `YoloV2::claimPrizes` function resulting in an incorrect protocol fees value

## Summary
Whenever a `protocolFeeOwed` is been paid in LOOKS, the current value of the `protocolFeeOwed` variable is not updated, thereby indicating a wrong `protocolFeeOwed` value. 

This happens in the `YoloV2::claimPrizes` and `YoloV2::rolloverETH` function 

## Vulnerability Detail

At [line 516](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L516)  in the `YoloV2::claimPrizes`

And at [line 698](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L698) in the `YoloV2::rolloverETH` function.
 
After paying the outstanding protocol fees owed with LOOKS the `protocolFeeOwed` variable value is not updated after or even before transfer both in the `YoloV2::claimPrizes` and `YoloV2::rolloverETH` function,

 But comparing that to the alternative ETH payment in the `YoloV2::claimPrizes` there is an update of the `protocolFeeOwed` value after the transfer 
```solidity
else {
                _transferETHAndWrapIfFailWithGasLimit(WETH, protocolFeeRecipient, protocolFeeOwed, gasleft());

                emit ProtocolFeePayment(protocolFeeOwed, address(0));

@-->                protocolFeeOwed -= msg.value;
                if (protocolFeeOwed <= ethAmount) {
                    unchecked {
@-->                        ethAmount -= protocolFeeOwed;
                    }
                } else {
                    revert ProtocolFeeNotPaid();
                }
            }
```

## Impact

This causes the `protocolFeeOwed` variable to be outdated & still hold outstanding fees whilst it has been paid in LOOKS

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `protocolFeeOwed` variable must be updated right before the transfer or after.
