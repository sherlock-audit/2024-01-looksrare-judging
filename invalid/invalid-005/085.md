# YOLOv2 lottery can be backrun

## Summary
There exists a sequence of actions that allow the attacker to have positive expectations (i.e. "win") the lottery by backrunning a deposit by other user. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Assume following sequence. 
1) User Bob deposits some amount of value to the protocol. 
2) Alice, who monitors mempool, sees that Bob's deposit satisfies criteria C (descirbed below) and then uses flashbots to couple Bob's and her deposits together. Alice can instantly trigger round Draw this way (as N of pariticipants is > 1 now), as she can control N of deposits to complete them to `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND`. 
3) As probabilty of winning is determined by N_deposit distribution, Alice has higher prob of winning then Bob, anytime Bob has less that `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND`/2, giving Alice positive expectation of win, even discounting that Bob's deposit can be higher than minimal amount per deposit. 
4) While owner can cancel such round, this can still also lead to effective DDOS attack. This attack can be triggered by bundling several separate but Alice-controlled EOAs/scs, obsuring the nature of attack. 

Thus Alice/attacker can basically force optimal conditions of lottery. Given that Mainnet is one of the target networks of deployment for this protocol, this attacks is very realistic. 

The criteria C of launching such an attacks are that BOB deposit > gascost + Alice minimal deposit amount adjusted by Bob's number of deposit (probobility of win  + protocol fees). 

## Impact
HIGH - potential DDOS or lottery gaming.

## Recommendation

Lottery design in onchain space is hard, and solutions generally involve raising the cost of sybiling. Increasing MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND or doing away with it is a good start.
