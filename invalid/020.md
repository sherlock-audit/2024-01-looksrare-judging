# Security Audit: Contracts-YOLO/YoloV2.sol

## Summary
We dug deep into the 'LooksRare YOLO' project's main code file, YoloV2.sol, to find and fix any potential issues that could cause problems. We looked at important things like how the code interacts with other parts, who can see what functions, making sure inputs are checked properly, keeping track of events, doing math operations safely, handling money transactions cautiously, checking the code with tests, and making sure there's enough documentation.

Our aim is to make the 'LooksRare YOLO' project strong and safe by giving a detailed report on any problems we find, possible risks, and ways to make it better. We want users and everyone involved to feel confident and secure in using 'LooksRare YOLO'.

## Vulnerability Detail
The drawWinner function in YoloV2.sol contains a vulnerability related to the verification of the minimum number of participants required for the draw. The existing implementation checks if (round.numberOfParticipants < 2) to ensure there are at least two participants before proceeding with the drawWinner logic. However, the intended behavior is to conduct the draw only when there is a minimum of one participant. This discrepancy in the condition (< 2 instead of < 1) can lead to the drawWinner function being executed erroneously when there are zero participants.
 I noticed that the contract does not include a function to withdraw Ether directly. If the contract has a positive balance, an attacker could potentially drain the contract by repeatedly calling the claimPrizes function with zero deposits.
 
## Impact
The vulnerability allows the drawWinner function to proceed even when the participant count is zero, which is contrary to the intended logic. This could result in unexpected behavior, compromising the reliability and fairness of the draw mechanism. Additionally, it may lead to undesired outcomes during the execution of the contract.

## Code Snippet

function drawWinner() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        uint256 roundId = roundsCount;
        Round storage round = rounds[roundId];

        _validateRoundStatus(round, RoundStatus.Open);

        if (block.timestamp < round.cutoffTime) {
            revert CutoffTimeNotReached();
        }
       // @audit-issue-1
        if (round.numberOfParticipants < 2) {
            revert InsufficientParticipants();
        }

        _drawWinner(round, roundId);
    }

##Severity:
Low-Medium

## Recommendation
This vulnerability should be addressed promptly to ensure the correct functioning of the drawWinner mechanism and maintain the integrity of the contract's operational logic.

To prevent the vulnerability no 2, consider adding a function to withdraw Ether directly, or implement a function to refund unused Ether at the end of a round.
