# Potential Reentrancy in ERC-20 Transfers

## Summary
The contract interacts with external ERC-20 contracts within the **_deposit** function without reentrancy protection, potentially exposing it to reentrancy attacks during token transfers.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the **_deposit** function, the contract calls **transferManager.transferBatchItemsAcrossCollections** to transfer ERC-20 tokens. If the ERC-20 token contract is malicious or has a bug, it might allow reentrancy into the YoloV2 contract, leading to unexpected behavior.
## Impact
If an attacker exploits reentrancy during ERC-20 token transfers, it may lead to loss of funds or manipulation of the contract state, potentially causing financial damage to users and disrupting the intended contract logic.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate reentrancy risks, consider using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and ensure all state changes are made before interacting with external contracts. Alternatively, use the **ReentrancyGuard** modifier from **OpenZeppelin** on functions that interact with external contracts.

Suggested Fix
Implement the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and use **ReentrancyGuard** for the **_deposit** function.

```solidity
// Add ReentrancyGuard to the contract inheritance
contract YoloV2 is ..., ReentrancyGuard {

    // Use the nonReentrant modifier to prevent reentrancy
    function _deposit(uint256 roundId, DepositCalldata[] calldata deposits) internal nonReentrant {
        // Perform checks and update state variables
        // ...
        
        // Interaction with external contract
        transferManager.transferBatchItemsAcrossCollections(batchTransferItems, msg.sender, address(this));
        // ...
    }
}
```
