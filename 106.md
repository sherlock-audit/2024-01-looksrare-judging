# `YoloV2.sol `  has storage clashes for state variables

## Summary
Storage collisions between the proxy contract and the implementation contract.
There can be collisions between the state variables defined for the proxy from the old implementation 
and the new implementation.


## Vulnerability Detail
For upgradeable contracts, there must be storage gap to allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments.

Refer to the bottom part of this article: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable

## Impact
reading from other memory locations

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
adding appropriate storage gap at the end of upgradeable contracts.
if you want to add new variables to the new  contract append them at the end of your state variables  list that you declared.
Don't remove state variables
