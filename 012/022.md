# Access Control and Permission Management

## Summary
The YoloV2 contract utilizes the AccessControl feature of OpenZeppelin to manage permissions and roles. However, if not properly managed or if the contract logic doesn't properly enforce these controls, unauthorized access could be granted, leading to potential manipulation or misuse of contract functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract has multiple sensitive functions that, if accessed by an unauthorized user, could be detrimental. For instance, functions like cancel, togglePaused, and updateCurrenciesStatus can significantly impact the contract's behavior and state. The proper assignment and management of roles are crucial to ensure that only authorized addresses can invoke these functions. A misconfiguration or oversight in the access control logic can lead to unauthorized access.

## Impact
If exploited, an unauthorized actor could alter critical contract parameters, pause the contract, drain funds, or manipulate the contract state, leading to loss of user funds, damage to the contract's integrity, and loss of trust from the users.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L748-L751

The _validateIsOwner function checks if the message sender has the appropriate role, but if these checks or role assignments are not correctly implemented, they could lead to vulnerabilities.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Role Management: Ensure that roles are assigned and managed securely. Use a minimal privilege principle, assigning only the necessary permissions to each role.
2. Audit Role Assignments: Regularly audit role assignments and access controls to ensure that only authorized addresses have critical permissions.
3. Use Secure Role-Based Access Control Patterns: Utilize OpenZeppelin's AccessControl or similar secure patterns for managing roles and permissions. Ensure that the role hierarchy and control mechanisms are well-understood and properly implemented.
4. Multi-Signature for Critical Functions: For extremely sensitive functions, consider implementing multi-signature requirements or timelocks to add an additional layer of security.
