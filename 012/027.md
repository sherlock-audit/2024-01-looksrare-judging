# Access Control and Role Management on interface

## Summary
The contract includes multiple roles with extensive permissions, like **DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE** and **OPERATOR**. Proper role management and access control are crucial to prevent unauthorized use or misconfiguration.
## Vulnerability Detail
Mismanagement of roles or unauthorized access to admin functions could lead to contract manipulation, misconfiguration, or unauthorized operations.
## Impact
Unauthorized access to admin functions can lead to misconfiguration, contract manipulation, or disruption, potentially causing financial losses or affecting the contract's integrity.

## Recommendation

1. **Role Management:** Ensure that roles are assigned and managed securely using the principle of least privilege.
2. **Secure Role-Based Access Control Patterns:** Utilize secure patterns for managing roles and permissions, like OpenZeppelin's AccessControl.
3. **Multi-Signature for Critical Functions:** For extremely sensitive functions, consider implementing multi-signature requirements or timelocks.
