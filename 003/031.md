# 'cancelAfterRandomnessRequest' function has no access control hence can be called by any address and not just the owner

## Summary

The cancelAfterRandomnessRequest function in the contract does not have an explicit access control mechanism in place to restrict it to the contract owner.


## Vulnerability Detail

The cancelAfterRandomnessRequest function is designed to cancel a round after a randomness request if the randomness request does not arrive after a certain amount of time. However, the function currently does not have any access control mechanisms in place to ensure that only the contract owner can call it. This could potentially allow any address to call the function and cancel the round, which could disrupt the normal operation of the contract.


## Impact
Without proper access control, any address can call the cancelAfterRandomnessRequest function and cancel the round.

   no access control in the cancelAfterRandomnessRequest function to make it only callable to the owner 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the 'YoloV2::_validateIsOwner()' function to ensure only the contract owner can call the 'cancelAfterRandomnessRequest' function.
