# _unsafeSubtract can led to error

## Summary
we are not verifying the _unsafeSubtract implementation as :
  uint256 currentEntryIndex = currentEntryIndexArray[_unsafeSubtract(count, 1)];

## Vulnerability Detail
uint256 currentEntryIndex = currentEntryIndexArray[_unsafeSubtract(count, 1)];
here count can be 0. then we will get an issue.
