# Due to the failure of just a single transfer, users will be unable to `withdrawDeposits` or `claimPrizes` for any of the funds.

## Summary
As per the README, users can participate in rounds using USDT.
> Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts?
Tokens that can interact with the contract will be on a whitelist basis.
USDT

However, USDT's ability to blacklist addresses means blacklisted users can't [withdrawDeposits](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/7d76b96a58a6aee38f23bb38b8a5daa3bdc03f7c/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L598) or [claimPrizes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/7d76b96a58a6aee38f23bb38b8a5daa3bdc03f7c/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L473), trapping all funds in the `YoloV2` contract.

The issue isn't limited to blacklistable USDT but applies to any token transfer failure (ERC20 or ERC721).

## Vulnerability Detail
Funds can be withdrawn via two functions:
1. [withdrawDeposits](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/7d76b96a58a6aee38f23bb38b8a5daa3bdc03f7c/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L598) - when a round is `Cancelled`
2. [claimPrizes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/7d76b96a58a6aee38f23bb38b8a5daa3bdc03f7c/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L473) - when a round is `Drawn`
Both call [_transferTokenOut](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/7d76b96a58a6aee38f23bb38b8a5daa3bdc03f7c/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L1463) for ERC20/ERC721/ETH transfers. For [ERC20 transfers](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/7d76b96a58a6aee38f23bb38b8a5daa3bdc03f7c/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L1478-L1492), it uses `LowLevelERC20Transfer._executeERC20DirectTransfer`, which reverts if a transfer fails.
```solidity
    function _executeERC20DirectTransfer(address currency, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (currency.code.length == 0) {
            revert NotAContract();
        }

        (bool status, bytes memory data) = currency.call(abi.encodeCall(IERC20.transfer, (to, amount)));

        if (!status) {
            revert ERC20TransferFail();
        }

        if (data.length > 0) {
            if (!abi.decode(data, (bool))) {
                revert ERC20TransferFail();
            }
        }
    }
```
If even one transfer fails, the user can't withdraw any funds.

POC:
1. Alice deposits 1 ETH, 1000DAI, and 1 PUDGY PENGUIN to participate.
2. Bob deposits just 1 USDT.
3. After the round is timed out, Alice, the winner, attempts to claim her rewards.
4. Being blacklisted from USDT, she can't claim any rewards, as they include USDT.

__The issue isn't limited to blacklistable USDT but applies to any token transfer failure (ERC20 or ERC721).__

## Impact
Users lose all deposited funds, not just the ones that fail, and the protocol misses its fees.

## Recommendation

Allow users to specify which tokens they wish to withdraw.
