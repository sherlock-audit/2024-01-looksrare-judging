# fulfillRandomWords() could revert under certain circumstances

## Summary
`fulfillRandomWords()` function faces a potential risk of reverting due to two primary factors: 
1. an existing check for randomnessRequests[requestId].exists
2. the possibility of running out of gas if winner should be already chosen for next round and `requestRandomWords()` is again called , as highlighted in the Chainlink VRF v2 documentation.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to chainlink : 
> If your fulfillRandomWords() implementation reverts, the VRF service will not attempt to call it a second time. Make sure your contract logic does not revert. Consider simply storing the randomness and taking more complex follow-on actions in separate contract calls made by you, your users, or an [Automation Node](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation)

But it could revert due to 2 reasons :

1. Check for Existing Randomness Request:
```solidity
if (randomnessRequests[requestId].exists) {
            revert RandomnessRequestAlreadyExists();
}
```
2. The Chainlink VRF v2 documentation advises against having fulfillRandomWords revert since it might run out of gas, especially if the callback function (i.e., fulfillRandomWords) performs complex operations or state changes and in Yolo it is possible that `fulfillRandomWords()` function process request again random words on VRF which is a complex operation that consumes a lot of gas : 
```solidity
function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] memory randomWords) internal override {
        //// ....  ////

                _startRound({_roundsCount: roundId});
                //// ....  ////
            }
        }
    }
function _startRound(uint256 _roundsCount) private returns (uint256 roundId) {
        //// ....  ////
            if (
                !paused() &&
                _shouldDrawWinner(numberOfParticipants, round.maximumNumberOfParticipants, round.deposits.length)
            ) {
                _drawWinner(round, roundId);
           //// ....  ////
    }

function _drawWinner(Round storage round, uint256 roundId) private {
    //// ....  ////
    uint256 requestId = VRF_COORDINATOR.requestRandomWords({...});
    //// ....  ////
}
```

## Impact
- DOS of the game where users that should have win are not able to claim their funds and inability to continue the game in a fair way
- Failure to comply with chainlink recommendation

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Re-design the way `fulfillRandomWords` could reach a new request of random words using chainlink recommendations
