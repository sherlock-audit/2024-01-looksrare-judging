# Gas Limitations and Looping through Arrays

## Summary
Functions like depositETHIntoMultipleRounds and claimPrizes involve loops over arrays. These operations can consume a high amount of gas, especially when called with large arrays, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors or making the function prohibitively expensive to call.

## Vulnerability Detail
Loops in contracts can lead to unbounded gas consumption, making functions fail if the loop iterates over too many elements. Moreover, attackers might be able to exploit such functions by deliberately calling them with inputs that maximize gas consumption.

## Impact
High gas consumption can make functions fail or be blocked due to block gas limits, rendering the contract unusable. It can also lead to denial of service, where legitimate users cannot use the contract because certain functions consistently run out of gas.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Limit the Array Size: Impose hard limits on the size of the arrays that can be processed.
2. Pagination: Implement pagination in functions, allowing them to process only a certain number of items at a time.
3. Gas Optimization: Optimize the code within loops to minimize the gas cost of each iteration.
4. Monitor Gas Usage: Regularly monitor the gas usage of functions and optimize them as necessary.
