# Protocol will be in emergency state due to the round with zero entries totally

## Summary
Malicious user can fill future rounds with zero entries by using multiple address via `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds` and system can't receive result from oracle.

## Vulnerability Detail
`depositETHIntoMultipleRounds` function allow zero deposits for current or future rounds i.e. [0, 0.01, 0.02, 0, 0], so user can participate in any round with zero value, and he can deposit 0 as many times as he want.
Let's say `valuePerEntry` is 0.01, current round is 1 and `maximumNumberOfParticipantsPerRound` is 20.
Then attacker can fill round 2, 3, ... with zero by using 20 different wallets to reach `maximumNumberOfParticipants` of round(Of course attacker can use MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND limit, but this maybe inefficient because this value may greater than participants limit generally).
wallet1: [0.01, 0, 0, 0, ...]
wallet2: [0.01, 0, 0, 0, ...]
...
wallet20: [0.01, 0, 0, 0, ...]
total entries of round 2, 3, ... are zero and participants are full, so when starting round, this will pass `_shouldDrawWinner`
Once random number request is submitted, VRFCoordinator will call `fulfillRandomWords` with result.
But `fulfillRandomWords` will revert due to the line below.
```solidity
uint256 winningEntry = _unsafeAdd(randomWord % currentEntryIndex, 1);
```
If a system is in this state, admin should pause or call `cancel()` for victim rounds, but if cancel() function can be backrun as soon as _startRound() finished, most rounds will be infected again except for some rounds with attackers wallet as participants

## Impact
Attacker can prevent the system core logic to being run by using minimal amount fund(0.01 * 20 * protocolFeeBp/10_000 in above case)
This have an different impact on the system even though this have the same a root cause with [#1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare-ashunter0327/issues/1)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
if (depositAmount % roundValuePerEntry != 0 || depositAmount == 0) { 
     revert InvalidValue(); 
 } 
```
or
```solidity
uint256 winningEntry = currentEntryIndex == 0 ? 0 : _unsafeAdd(randomWord % currentEntryIndex, 1);
```
