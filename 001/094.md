# MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND can be bypassed in certain conditions

## Summary
The `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds()` function in the smart contract fails to adequately enforce the `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND` constraint for rounds beyond the current round. This could potentially lead to a breach of the contract's intended limitations on deposits per round.

## Vulnerability Detail
`depositETHIntoMultipleRounds()` is designed to allow players to deposit into multiple rounds with a single transaction. 
However, this function does not thoroughly validate the maximum number of deposits allowed for each round beyond the starting round. This oversight can lead to a situation where the number of deposits exceeds the intended limit.
```solidity
function depositETHIntoMultipleRounds(uint256[] calldata amounts) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    ...
    for (uint256 i; i < numberOfRounds; ++i) {
        uint256 roundId = _unsafeAdd(startingRoundId, i);
        Round storage round = rounds[roundId];
        ...
        uint256 entriesCount = _depositETH(round, roundId, roundValuePerEntry, depositAmount);
        ...
    }
    ...
    if (
            _shouldDrawWinner(
                startingRound.numberOfParticipants,
                startingRound.maximumNumberOfParticipants,
                startingRound.deposits.length
            )
        ) {
            _drawWinner(startingRound, startingRoundId);
        }
     ....
}
```
In the loop, roundId is incremented to deposit into subsequent rounds. However, the check for `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND` is only done via `_shouldDrawWinner` performed for `startingRound.numberOfParticipants` 


`_depositETH` in fact check for MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND but doesn't revert if numberOfParticipants is not 1 : 
```solidity
function _validateOnePlayerCannotFillUpTheWholeRound(
    uint256 roundDepositCount,
    uint256 numberOfParticipants
) private pure {
    if (roundDepositCount == MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND) { 
        if (numberOfParticipants == 1) { revert OnePlayerCannotFillUpTheWholeRound(); }
    }
}
```
This function only checks whether a single player is filling up the round. It does not ensure that the total number of deposits does not exceed the maximum limit.

The only check related to `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND` is done here : 
```solidity
function _incrementUserDepositCount(uint256 roundId, Round storage round) private {
        uint256 userDepositCount = depositCount[roundId][msg.sender];
        if (userDepositCount == 0) {
            uint256 numberOfParticipants = round.numberOfParticipants;
            if (numberOfParticipants == round.maximumNumberOfParticipants) {
                revert MaximumNumberOfParticipantsReached();
            }
            unchecked {
                round.numberOfParticipants = uint40(numberOfParticipants + 1);
            }
        }
        unchecked {
            depositCount[roundId][msg.sender] = userDepositCount + 1;
        }
    }
```

Regarding the contract, `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND = 100` and regarding tests, `maximumNumberOfParticipantsPerRound = 50` but if  `maximumNumberOfParticipantsPerRound` becomes bigger than `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND` due to a change in the protocol, `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND` can be bypassed by this function which could break `_shouldDrawWinner()` function as this function check for strict equality : 

```solidity
function _shouldDrawWinner(
        uint256 numberOfParticipants,
        uint256 maximumNumberOfParticipants,
        uint256 roundDepositCount
    ) private pure returns (bool shouldDraw) {
        shouldDraw =
            numberOfParticipants == maximumNumberOfParticipants ||
            (numberOfParticipants > 1 && roundDepositCount == MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND);
    }
```


## Impact
If `maximumNumberOfParticipantsPerRound` is set higher than `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND`, players could deposit into future rounds in a way that exceeds the intended maximum deposit limit , disrupting the fairness of the game

## Recommendation
 Implement a check in `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds()` to ensure that for each round the player attempts to deposit into, the maximum number of deposits has not been exceeded
