# User can get free entries to rounds

## Summary

User can get as many free entries as he want for as many rounds as he want

## Vulnerability Detail

User can get as many entries as he wants for as many rounds as he want for the cost of only 1 deposit for 1 round

This can be done by abusing `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds`:

```solidity
function depositETHIntoMultipleRounds(uint256[] calldata amounts) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {

        uint256 numberOfRounds = amounts.length;

        if (msg.value == 0 || numberOfRounds == 0) {
            revert ZeroDeposits();
        }

        uint256 startingRoundId = roundsCount;

        Round storage startingRound = rounds[startingRoundId];

        _validateRoundIsOpen(startingRound);

        _setCutoffTimeIfNotSet(startingRound);

        uint256 expectedValue;

        uint256[] memory entriesCounts = new uint256[](numberOfRounds);
 
        for (uint256 i; i < numberOfRounds; ++i) {

            uint256 roundId = _unsafeAdd(startingRoundId, i);

            Round storage round = rounds[roundId];

            uint256 roundValuePerEntry = round.valuePerEntry;

            if (roundValuePerEntry == 0) {
                (, , roundValuePerEntry) = _writeDataToRound({roundId: roundId, roundValue: 0});
            }

            _incrementUserDepositCount(roundId, round);

            uint256 depositAmount = amounts[i];
            
            if (depositAmount % roundValuePerEntry != 0) {
                revert InvalidValue();
            }

            uint256 entriesCount = _depositETH(round, roundId, roundValuePerEntry, depositAmount);

            expectedValue += depositAmount;

            entriesCounts[i] = entriesCount;
        }

        if (expectedValue != msg.value) {
            revert InvalidValue();
        }

        emit MultipleRoundsDeposited(msg.sender, startingRoundId, amounts, entriesCounts);

        if (
            _shouldDrawWinner(
                startingRound.numberOfParticipants,
                startingRound.maximumNumberOfParticipants,
                startingRound.deposits.length
            )
        ) {
            _drawWinner(startingRound, startingRoundId);
        }
        
    }

```

The user can construct the input array like that for example (keep in mind numbers are just for easier understanding):

`**uint256[] calldata amounts** = **[1eth, 0, 0]**` - basically 1eth for the current(first) round, the 0 for the second and 0 for the third. And this will be valid since:


```solidity
uint256 numberOfRounds = amounts.length;

        if (msg.value == 0 || numberOfRounds == 0) {
            revert ZeroDeposits();
        }


```

msg.value > 0 and also there are numberOfRounds - 3.

Then:

```solidity

        uint256 startingRoundId = roundsCount;

        Round storage startingRound = rounds[startingRoundId];

        _validateRoundIsOpen(startingRound);

        _setCutoffTimeIfNotSet(startingRound);

        uint256 expectedValue;

        uint256[] memory entriesCounts = new uint256[](numberOfRounds);

```

just some checks let's assume everything is alright here. Let's go into the **for** loop of the function:

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < numberOfRounds; ++i) {

            uint256 roundId = _unsafeAdd(startingRoundId, i);

            Round storage round = rounds[roundId];

            uint256 roundValuePerEntry = round.valuePerEntry;

            if (roundValuePerEntry == 0) {
                (, , roundValuePerEntry) = _writeDataToRound({roundId: roundId, roundValue: 0});
            }

            _incrementUserDepositCount(roundId, round);

            uint256 depositAmount = amounts[i];
            
            if (depositAmount % roundValuePerEntry != 0) {
                revert InvalidValue();
            }

            uint256 entriesCount = _depositETH(round, roundId, roundValuePerEntry, depositAmount);

            expectedValue += depositAmount;

            entriesCounts[i] = entriesCount;
        }

```

Now for the first round we have prepared 1eth, we are added as participants for that round by `_incrementUserDepositCount`, then our deposit amount is stored in `uint256 depositAmount = amounts[i];`, then our deposit is pushed to the deposits for the current round by `_depositETH` and **important** that `expectedValue += depositAmount`, `expectedValue` will be later used as a check to ensure we have provided enough amount for our deposits. Now let's get to the second round but now our amount is 0, the same scenario as above is performed and since there are no checks to prevent 0 amount deposits, we are once again added as participants for the round and our `0 amount deposit` is added to the deposits of the round. Lets just end the for cycle here, you get the idea now.

`if (expectedValue != msg.value) {
            revert InvalidValue();
        }
`

this check at the end ensures that we have provided enough msg.value for every deposit we made, but as you can see we made 3 total deposits but we paid only for 1, so this check will pass successfully.


## Impact

A user can use this to fill up a round with `0 amount deposits` to ddos a round, or he can use this in his advantage to get as many deposits as he can to have better chance to be selected for the `winner` of the round by `fulfillRandomWords`.

## Recommendation

Make sure 0 amount deposits are impossible.
