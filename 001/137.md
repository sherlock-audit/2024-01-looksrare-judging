# The number of deposits for future rounds may exceed `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND`

## Summary
Due to the lack of appropriate checks in function `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds`, the number of deposits in future rounds may exceed `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND`. This violates the expected behavior of the function and will possibly lead to an error due to lack of gas in the `fulfillRandomWords` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `depositETHIntoMultipleRounds` function only check if `roundDepositCount == MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND`. In case the `roundDepositCount` of the next round is already equals `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND` the new deposit will be added when the round will became current. Once the number of deposits exceeds bbb, they can be added without restrictions.
```solidity
    function _shouldDrawWinner(
        uint256 numberOfParticipants,
        uint256 maximumNumberOfParticipants,
        uint256 roundDepositCount
    ) private pure returns (bool shouldDraw) {
        shouldDraw =
            numberOfParticipants == maximumNumberOfParticipants ||
            (numberOfParticipants > 1 && roundDepositCount == MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND);
    }
```

## Impact
The code does not work as expected. In case of error at the `fulfillRandomWords`, the protocol will lose the fee for the failed round.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider checking that current round does not exceed the `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_DEPOSITS_PER_ROUND` with the same check as at the `_deposit` function.
