# VRF ` Min Request Confirmations` Fixed At 3 in contract which is < Depth Of Chain ReOrgs For Chain To Be Deployed On

## Summary

When requesting randomness in the `_drawWinner` function, the `minimumRequestConfirmations` parameter is set to 3. This value must be greater than the depth of common chain re-organizations on the chains the `YoloV2`  is to be deployed, as chain re-organizations re-order blocks & transactions, which can affect the returned randomness.

## Vulnerability Detail

This could result in a winner becoming a loser or vice-versa due to the chain re-organization re-ordering the randomness request, resulting in a different randomness result.
This is less than the common chain re-org values on polygon.
You can check out the common re-orgs depth for polygon POS under re-orgs depth and see how frequent its greater than 3 [here](https://polygonscan.com/blocks_forked).

How do i know `YoloV2` would be deployed on polygon POS.
Here is a discord message from one of the team members validating that if you actually find an issue that is specific to Polygon, then it should be a valid issue [here](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1197556030943539230/1197843127654957096)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Increase the `minimumRequestConfirmations` from 3 or include its as a constructor parameter on deployment.
