# Incompatibility of Hardcoded Uniswap V3 Factory Address Across Different Chains

## Summary
The PriceOracle contract in the `YOLOV2` ecosystem is hardcoded with the Uniswap V3 Factory address specific to Ethereum Mainnet, leading to potential incompatibility issues when deployed on other Layer 2 networks or chains like Base and BNB Chain (and any other layer 2 which doesn't has the hardcoded address as an UniV3 factory).

## Vulnerability Detail
PriceOracle contract is used for `_deposit()` and `_protocolFeeOwedInLOOKS()` on Yolo contract.

In the PriceOracle contract, the address for the Uniswap V3 Factory is hardcoded as follows:
```solidity
IUniswapV3Factory private constant UNISWAP_V3_FACTORY =
    IUniswapV3Factory(0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984);
```

However regarding [this document](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/deployments), address of the Uniswap V3 Factory is different on Bnb,Celo and Base chains

According to the contest's README, the contracts are intended to be deployed on various EVM-compatible Layer 2 networks, including Base and potentially others like BNB Chain, where the Uniswap V3 Factory address differs.

The PriceOracle contract uses this factory address to fetch pool information and calculate the Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) of tokens:
```solidity
function getTWAP(address token, uint32 secondsAgo) external view returns (uint256 price) {
    address pool = oracles[token];
    ...
    (int24 arithmeticMeanTick, ) = OracleLibrary.consult(pool, secondsAgo);
    ...
}
```


**You should have a look at here : https://basescan.org/address/0x00000000001725AD5E2aB41f2f39D44c50A68751#code
and redeploy this contract because [there is nothing at `0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984` on Base chain](https://basescan.org/address/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984)

## Impact
Incompatibility of the contract on other layer 2

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the contract to accept the Uniswap V3 Factory address as an input parameter during deployment or initialization.
