# If contract is paused during `_startRound`, users may be forced to wait until `cutoffTime` to resume rounds.

## Summary
If contract is paused during `_startRound`, users may be forced to wait until `cutoffTime` to resume rounds.

## Vulnerability Detail
In case the next round has max number of participants/deposits, it is usually drawn immediately when calling `_startRound`. However, this is not the case, if the contract is paused.
 ```solidity
            if (
                !paused() &&
                _shouldDrawWinner(numberOfParticipants, round.maximumNumberOfParticipants, round.deposits.length)
            ) {
                _drawWinner(round, roundId);
            } else {
                uint40 _roundDuration = roundDuration;
                // This is equivalent to
                // round.status = RoundStatus.Open;
                // if (round.numberOfParticipants > 0) {
                //   round.cutoffTime = uint40(block.timestamp) + _roundDuration;
                // }
                uint256 roundSlot = _getRoundSlot(roundId);
                assembly {
                    // RoundStatus.Open is equal to 1.
                    let roundValue := or(sload(roundSlot), 1)

                    if gt(numberOfParticipants, 0) {
                        roundValue := or(roundValue, shl(ROUND__CUTOFF_TIME_OFFSET, add(timestamp(), _roundDuration)))
                    }

                    sstore(roundSlot, roundValue)
                }

                emit RoundStatusUpdated(roundId, RoundStatus.Open);
            }
```

Let's consider the case where the next round should be drawn (e.g. max depositors reached) but the contract is paused.
In this scenario the round will not be drawn, but instead a cutoff time will be set. 
Then, even if the contract is unpaused, there will be no way to draw the round, even though it should be drawn. Users will be forced to wait until cutoff time.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a function which allows to draw winner early in case there's max depositors/ deposits
