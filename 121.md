# The protocol might suffer badly negtive ROI due to lack of base fee

## Summary
According current implementation and configures, in each round, the chainlink ````VRF```` fee, which the protocol team should pay and maintain, could be up to ````~0.12```` ETH, but the fee collected by ````YOLO```` could be as low as only ````0.001```` ETH. There are wide range occurrences that the protocol suffer badly negative ROI.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's the take Ethereum mainnet as an example to illustrate the problem:
### 1. Firstly, let's see how ````VRF```` fee is calculated  
```solidity
File: src\v0.8\dev\VRFCoordinatorV2.sol
605:   function calculatePaymentAmount(
606:     uint256 startGas,
607:     uint256 gasAfterPaymentCalculation,
608:     uint32 fulfillmentFlatFeeLinkPPM,
609:     uint256 weiPerUnitGas
610:   ) internal view returns (uint96) {
611:     int256 weiPerUnitLink;
612:     weiPerUnitLink = getFeedData();
613:     if (weiPerUnitLink <= 0) {
614:       revert InvalidLinkWeiPrice(weiPerUnitLink);
615:     }
616:     // (1e18 juels/link) (wei/gas * gas) / (wei/link) = juels
617:     uint256 paymentNoFee = (1e18 * weiPerUnitGas * (gasAfterPaymentCalculation + startGas - gasleft())) /
618:       uint256(weiPerUnitLink);
619:     uint256 fee = 1e12 * uint256(fulfillmentFlatFeeLinkPPM);
620:     if (paymentNoFee > (1e27 - fee)) {
621:       revert PaymentTooLarge(); // Payment + fee cannot be more than all of the link in existence.
622:     }
623:     return uint96(paymentNoFee + fee);
624:   }
```
(1) gas cost of whole VRF fulfillment transaction (L617\~L618), including both the ````Caller```` part in chainlink contact and the ````Callee```` part in YOLO contract.  The fixed gas usage of ````Caller```` is about ````100K````, and the max gas usage of ````Callee````, YOLO's ````rawFulfillRandomWords()```` function, is ````500K````. And ````KeyHash```` used is ````0x8af3...e7ef````, chainlink oracle would execute fulfillment  with gas price up to ````200K Gwei````. Therefore, the max gas cost would be ````600K * 200Gwei = 0.12ETH````.
```solidity
File: contracts-yolo\contracts\YoloV2.sol
1005:             callbackGasLimit: uint32(500_000),

File: scripts\deployment\NetworkConfig.json
10:     "keyHash": "0x8af398995b04c28e9951adb9721ef74c74f93e6a478f39e7e0777be13527e7ef",
```

(2) a fixed amount of LINK as compensation (L619), currently it's ````0.25```` LINK.

To sum up, the max VRF fee is ````0.12ETH + 0.25LINK````. With price of ETH (````$2200````) and LINK (````$14````) at the writing time, we get the max VRF fee in USD is ````0.12 * 2200 + 0.25 * 14 ~= $268````. Even with more realistic estimation, let's say the gas price is ````50 Gwei```` and gas usage is ````300K````, the VRF fee is still at ````0.015 * 2200 + 0.25 * 14 ~= $37````.

### 2. the round fee collected by YOLO
As current deployment config, the fee charges at fixed percentage of ````5%````. The minimum valid deposit amount is ````valuePerEntry * 2 = 0.01ETH * 2 = 0.02ETH````. So, the minimum fee is only ````0.02ETH * 5% = 0.001ETH = $2.2````. In a more realistic  case, let's say there is 10 ````Entries```` in round, which would produce ````$11```` fee.


### 3. Conclusion
In extreme case, the protocol team would suffer badly negative ROI (````$-268 VS $+2.2````), and even in normal cases might also suffer losses (````$-37 VS $+11````).

## Impact
The issue also makes grief attack available, as users can deposit for future rounds while gas price is very low, but the VRF fulfillment would automatically progress even while the gas price is high.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a gas price dominated ````base fee```` to cover VRF fee
