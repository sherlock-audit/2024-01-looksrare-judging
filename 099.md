# Round can unexpectedly end earlier than cutoffTime, after unpause() function is called

## Summary
Function `_unpause()` does not update the cutoffTime variable. In case of pausing the contract for some amount of time and unpause, the pause period will be unwillingly deducted from the roundDuration. Every time pause is called, round would end earlier than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

- At the beginning of a new round, `_startRound()` is called, `cutoffTime` will be set to:`round.cutoffTime = uint40(block.timestamp) + _roundDuration;` , let's assume that _roundDuration is 10 minutes.
- After that, at the 5th minute of the current round, owner decides to pause the contract with calling `togglePaused()`.
- Let's assume the contract is paused for 2 mins. After that, `_unpause()` function will be called with no time updates and checks in it and contract will continue for 3 more mins.
- In the end, round will be completed at `uint40(block.timestamp) + _roundDuration` however the contract was paused for 2 mins.
- So, the round actually lasted for `_roundDuration - pausePeriod`, 8 mins.
However at the beginning of the round, it was stated that round will last for 10 mins .

        _subscribeYoloToVRF();
        _fillARoundWithSingleETHDeposit();

        // as mentioned in _startRound(), round duration is 10 mins.
        uint256 cutoffTime = block.timestamp + ROUND_DURATION;
        
        // assume that round will continue for 5 mins
        uint256 beforePausePeriod = ROUND_DURATION / 2;
        skip(beforePausePeriod);
        
        vm.prank(owner);
        yolo.togglePaused();

        assertTrue(yolo.paused());
        assertNotEq(cutoffTime, 0);

        uint256 pausePeriod = 2 minutes;
        skip(pausePeriod);

        vm.prank(owner);
        yolo.togglePaused();
        assertFalse(yolo.paused());

        // since ROUND_DURATION is 10 minutes, 5 mins were the first half, 2 mins were the pausePeriod, 
        // 3 mins left for second half which is 2 mins shorter than it supposed to be.
        // assertNotEq passes because actual timePassedAsRoundDuration is not equal to ROUND_DURATION
        uint256 afterPausePeriod = ROUND_DURATION - (beforePausePeriod + pausePeriod);
        skip(afterPausePeriod);
        uint256 timePassedAsRoundDuration = beforePausePeriod + afterPausePeriod;
        assertNotEq(timePassedAsRoundDuration, ROUND_DURATION);
    }
```

## Impact

If this is not notified to the depositors who wants to increase their chance to win by depositing in the last minutes without letting other depositors to deposit after themselves, this situation will create unfairness and trust issues about the game. Round will unexpectedly end at the wrong time without notifying the depositors.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`_unpause()` function should update the `roundDuration` with using `_updateRoundDuration()`
