# Protocol won't work properly on Base Chain due to missing VRF requesting functionality

## Summary
Protocol won't work properly on Base Chain due to missing VRF requesting functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail
LooksRare YOLO v2 will be deployed on Ethereum Mainnet and Base Chain.

To draw a winner for each round, protocol will send request to Chainlink VRF to get random numbers. 

Because Chainlink VRF does not support Base Chain, so Gelato VRF is expected to be used to fulfill randomness on Base, as said in the Audit Page.
> Chainlink VRF is used to fulfill randomness on mainnet and Arbitrum
Gelato VRF is used to fulfill randomness on Base

However, Gelato VRF requesting functionality is not implemented in the code, this means protocol won't work properly on Base Chain.

## Impact
Protocol cannot get random number on Base Chain, no winner will be drawn.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement and use Gelato VRF requesting functionality if deployed chain is Base Chain.
