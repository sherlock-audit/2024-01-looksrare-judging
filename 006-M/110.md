# Depositing into future rounds renders protocol value updates useless

## Summary
Depositing into future rounds renders protocol value updates useless as future rounds value cannot be changed.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a round is [started](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L949), if the round's `valuePerEntry` is 0, some values will be written to the round:
```solidity
        if (round.valuePerEntry == 0) {
            // On top of the 4 values covered by _writeDataToRound, this also writes the round's status to Open (1).
            _writeDataToRound({roundId: roundId, roundValue: 1});
            emit RoundStatusUpdated(roundId, RoundStatus.Open);
        }
```
The written values are `maximumNumberOfParticipantsPerRound`, `protocolFeeBp` and `valuePerEntry`:
```solidity
        assembly {
            roundValue := or(
                roundValue,
                shl(ROUND__MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PARTICIPANTS_OFFSET, _maximumNumberOfParticipantsPerRound)
            )
            roundValue := or(roundValue, shl(ROUND__PROTOCOL_FEE_BP_OFFSET, _protocolFeeBp))

            sstore(roundSlot, roundValue)
            sstore(
                add(roundSlot, ROUND__VALUE_PER_ENTRY_SLOT_OFFSET),
                shl(ROUND__VALUE_PER_ENTRY_OFFSET, _valuePerEntry)
            )
        }
```
Protocol owner can update these 3 values through [updateMaximumNumberOfParticipantsPerRound()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L827) function, [updateProtocolFeeBp()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L811) function and [updateValuePerEntry()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L795) function, and it is expected the updates to be effective in the next round.

Protocol also allows users deposit into future rounds by calling [depositETHIntoMultipleRounds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-looksrare/blob/main/contracts-yolo/contracts/YoloV2.sol#L312) function, and `maximumNumberOfParticipants`, `protocolFeeBp` and `valuePerEntry` will be written into future rounds:
```solidity
                (, , roundValuePerEntry) = _writeDataToRound({roundId: roundId, roundValue: 0});
```
The problem is that when values are written into the rounds, it cannot be changed anymore, so even if owner updates those protocol values, it won't take effect in the future rounds, this simply renders the value updates useless.

Even though owner can cancel the future rounds after updating protocol values, the depositors will be affected, they will have to pay unnecessary gas fee to withdraw funds and re-deposit into new rounds, if the future rounds are too many, it could be a heavy loss to the users.

## Impact
1. Protocol value updates cannot be effect in the next round;
2. User has to pay unnecessary gas fee to withdraw if rounds are cancelled by owner.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to write values to round whenever the round is started:
```diff
-       if (round.valuePerEntry == 0) {
            // On top of the 4 values covered by _writeDataToRound, this also writes the round's status to Open (1).
            _writeDataToRound({roundId: roundId, roundValue: 1});
            emit RoundStatusUpdated(roundId, RoundStatus.Open);
-       } else {
```
If `valuePerEntry` is updated, update entries count accordingly, or owner send back funds to depositors if necessary, instead of cancelling rounds directly and forcing user to pay gas fee to withdraw themselves.
