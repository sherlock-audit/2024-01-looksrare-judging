# The protocol fee can be wrongly calculated.

## Summary

Changes in the protocol fee discount rate can lead to users paying a lower fee than originally intended, resulting in potential revenue loss for the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue arises during the fee calculation process following the determination of a winner through Chainlink's random word return. The protocol fee in ETH is calculated based on the round's value, entry index, and protocol fee basis points (Bp).

        round.protocolFeeOwed = (round.valuePerEntry * currentEntryIndex * round.protocolFeeBp) / 10_000;

When winners claim their rewards, they can opt to pay the protocol fee in ETH or LOOKS. Paying in LOOKS offers a discount, the rate of which is set by `protocolFeeDiscountBp`.

        function _protocolFeeOwedInLOOKS(
            uint256 protocolFeeOwedInETH
        ) private view returns (uint256 protocolFeeOwedInLOOKS) {
            protocolFeeOwedInLOOKS =
                (1e18 * protocolFeeOwedInETH * protocolFeeDiscountBp) /
                erc20Oracle.getTWAP(LOOKS, uint32(TWAP_DURATION)) /
                10_000;
        }

The contract permits the admin to update the `protocolFeeDiscountBp`, which means the discount rate can change between the time of fee calculation and actual payment by the winner. This adjustment can lead to winners paying a reduced fee if the discount rate is increased after the initial calculation.

        function updateProtocolFeeDiscountBp(uint16 _protocolFeeDiscountBp) external {
            _validateIsOwner();
            _updateProtocolFeeDiscountBp(_protocolFeeDiscountBp);
        }

## Impact

This scenario creates a potential revenue loss for the protocol and unfairness, as winners from past rounds could benefit from a lower fee due to the retrospective application of increased discount rates.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

cache the `protocolFeeDiscountBp` at the time of initial fee calculation and use this cached value when calculating fees payable in LOOKS.

```diff
        function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] memory randomWords) internal override {
            ...
            round.winner = round.deposits[currentEntryIndexArray.findUpperBound(winningEntry)].depositor;
            round.protocolFeeOwed = (round.valuePerEntry * currentEntryIndex * round.protocolFeeBp) / 10_000;
+           round.protocolFeeDiscountBp = protocolFeeDiscountBp;
            ...
        }

        function _protocolFeeOwedInLOOKS(
+           Round storage round,
            uint256 protocolFeeOwedInETH
        ) private view returns (uint256 protocolFeeOwedInLOOKS) {
            protocolFeeOwedInLOOKS =
-               (1e18 * protocolFeeOwedInETH * protocolFeeDiscountBp) /
+               (1e18 * protocolFeeOwedInETH * round.protocolFeeDiscountBp) /
                erc20Oracle.getTWAP(LOOKS, uint32(TWAP_DURATION)) /
                10_000;
        }
```
